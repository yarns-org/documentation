- **Open-source**
- **Offline-first**: ability to use the application while offline and then sync the changes whenever needed
- **Privacy-friendly**: no third-party collection of any personal information that is not meant to be shared with others
- **One app to rule them all**: discover and rate works of all kinds (e.g., books, films, TV series)
- **Good performance**: fast loading and response times
- **Future-proof**: when a provider ceases to work on the software, changes its pricing, or updates its TOS, one can easily change or back up information
